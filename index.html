    <h3>Project 1: Sales Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      In this project, I analyzed sales data for a large retail company. I used SQL to extract and manipulate the data, and then used Python and matplotlib to create visualizations. The insights I gained from the analysis helped the company make informed decisions about inventory management and marketing strategies.

    <h3>Project 2: Social Media Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      For this project, I analyzed social media data to understand user behavior and trends. I used R and the tidyverse package to clean and organize the data, and then used ggplot2 to create visualizations. The findings from this analysis were used to improve the effectiveness of the company's social media marketing campaigns.
